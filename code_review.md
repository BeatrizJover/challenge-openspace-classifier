## Remarks
+ comments in spanish, please write them in english
+ good readme
+ putt the dataset in the repo to make sure to show how it works (in case you modify the format for example)
+ good trello organization :fire:
+ remaining branches on remote, it's better to clean them when it's finished
+ some of your variable names are not well-named: numberofseatspertable, it's not readable. Please do something like this: number_of_seats_per_table
+ missing ```__str__``` method in openspace
+ file_utils not used

## General remark
Good project! :fire:
